I then later on had to do a live review to fix some stuff on my lesson, because it was in python, and we were supposed to teach Javascript. Second tri, I wasn't able to do any live reviews, mostly because the schedules of my teamates and my own dont line up well, so while my teamates are free, im doing something like fencing practice."

I feel like I did decent in those catergories, I would like to do more but we dont get infinite time in life and thats how it is. I was able to get a good ammout of feedback from people during my demos and I was able to look at a good ammount of other people's work and to reflect on their code and my own."

Before, if I would be shown the code that we have to do today, I probably would have been amazed and/or confused, but now I can actually somewhat understand code and write code. \n",
