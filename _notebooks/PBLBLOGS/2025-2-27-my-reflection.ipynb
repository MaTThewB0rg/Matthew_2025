I want to learn more about coding and get better, but this feeling is on and off. I also tend to have big goals I want to achieve, and when I cant do it all I feel dissapointed. These factors are all a by-product of my experience with coding."

    "To summarize what I said, even though I may not want to do any more comp sci now, who knows? I may in the future want to do it again, and with the skills I learned and maybe with other help such as my dad, I may be succesful in coding in the future, but for now I feel like its not necesarily the best for me at the moment.
