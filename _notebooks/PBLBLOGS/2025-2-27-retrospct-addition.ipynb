It includes shooting so I wont get much into detail, but the main idea is to plant a defuser to defuse one of two bomb sites in the map. Defenders get gadgets to help ward off the attackers trying to defuse, and attackers get utility to also ward off and kill off the defenders and either kill them all or get defuse done in time. "
