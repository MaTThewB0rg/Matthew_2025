    "# Movement speed\n",
    "In the following code, I changed the player movement speed. I did this because I noticed that the plaer would move inconsistent and sometimes move faster down or up compared to moving left or right. I fixed this by setting a speed multiplier for up and down so it has a set speed that can be controlled. The first time I changed and sort of fixed it I got the player to move smooth, but it was very slow. I then changed it to the code I have now, which is exponentially better."
