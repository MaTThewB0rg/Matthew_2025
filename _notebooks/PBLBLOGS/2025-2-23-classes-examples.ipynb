    "## Instantiating Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instantiating Objects in code is creating an instance of a class that has the same properties and behaviors as the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "new LevelClass(this.path): In the loadLevel method, the LevelClass (which is one of GameLevelDesert or GameLevelWater) is instantiated using new *LevelClass(this.path)*. This creates an instance of a level with the path passed as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are functions that are associated with an object or class. Methods define the behavior of an object or class and typically operate on the data contained within the object or class. Methods are called on objects or classes to perform specific actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example from GameControl.js: *start(path)*, This method is the main starting point, which initializes various components for the game. It calls several other methods: *GameEnv.create()*, *this.addExitKeyListener()*, and *this.loadLevel()*.\n",
    "## Using Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using objects in code is basically the use of objects, and Objects are used to provide methods and store code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In GameControl.js, the *this.* in *this.handleLevelStart();* is used to refer to the current instance of the object where the method handleLevelStart() is being called from, and this is also an example of Calling Methods\n",
    "## Calling Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling methods as shown above are used to call methods to the current instance. Methods are called using the dot or period notation.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In GameControl.js, *this.handleLevelEnd();* is calling *hadleLevelEnd()* to the current instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Return Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "Return values are Methods with an added on return statement that can make the Method return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "\n",
    " *getCurrentLevel: function() {*\n",
    "\n",
    "*return this.levelClasses[this.currentLevelIndex];*\n",
    "\n",
    "This method returns the current level class *(this.levelClasses[this.currentLevelIndex])*, which is a useful value you can use elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters are variables that are used to pass information into a function or method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: *path* is a parameter of the start method. When *start()* is called, the *path* parameter will be passed in and used to set *this.path* inside the *GameControl* object.\n",
