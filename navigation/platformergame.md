# Platformer Game

As I worked with my team on the platformer game, I was able to do some stuff and change the game to fit the overall theme we were going for. I was absent for a while so my team did a lot of the work, but that didn't mean I didn't need to do anything. 

## Contribution

As I worked on the game, I made some changes that helped my team. For example, I changed the image of the coin you need to collect in the game. I also changed the pipe you usually exit to the next level. I changed it to a picture of Tyler the Creator to fit Tyler the Creator's theme, and it worked well.
