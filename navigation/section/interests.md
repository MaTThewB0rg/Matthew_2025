### My interests

My interests include gaming, going out with friends, and family. One game I enjoy is Dying Light.

Dying Light is a 2015 survival horror video game developed by Techland and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The game's story follows an undercover agent named Kyle Crane who is sent to infiltrate a quarantine zone in a fictional Middle Eastern city called Harran.

Another thing I enjoy is Destiny 2. Destiny 2 is a free-to-play online first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie. It was originally released as a pay-to-play game in 2017 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows.

### My Family

My family consists of my Mom, my Dad, and my little sister. Both my Mom and Dad are 50 years old, and my sister is 9 years old and is a 4th grader at MRES. I used to have a dog that was with my family for a very long time, 13 years to be exact, but back in 2020-2021 right when we were going back to in-person school, he was put down because he had a waist problem, was limping, and overall he was in an immense amount of pain.
