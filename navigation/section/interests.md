### My interests

My interests include gaming, going out with friends, and family. One game I enjoy is Dying Light.

Dying Light is a 2015 survival horror video game developed by Techland and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The game's story follows an undercover agent named Kyle Crane who is sent to infiltrate a quarantine zone in a fictional Middle Eastern city called Harran.

Another thing I enjoy is Destiny 2. Destiny 2 is a free-to-play online first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie. It was originally released as a pay-to-play game in 2017 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows.

### My Family

My family consists of my Mom, my Dad, and my little sister. Both my Mom and Dad are 50 years old, and my sister is 9 years old and is a 4th grader at MRES. I used to have a dog that was with my family for a very long time, 13 years to be exact, but back in 2020-2021 right when we were going back to in-person school, he was put down because he had a waist problem, was limping, and overall he was in an immense amount of pain.

**THE ONE AND ONLY PLANTS VERSUS ZOMBIES: GARDEN WARFARE 2**

[PVZ:GW2](https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare-2) is a 2016 third-person shooter video game developed by PopCap Games and published by Electronic Arts. It was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. It is the sequel to Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare and the fourth game in the Plants vs. Zombies franchise. I personally love this game because it was one of the first games I actually used to play a lot when I was younger. It was very fun, and i was very addicted
