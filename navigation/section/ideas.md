###My ideas for rpg game

Here are some of my ideas I could implement into my rpg game.

1. A maze
2. tag
3. a race game
4. a cool experience like going inside and outside the white house
5. a looter game
6. an arcade type spaceship shooting game
7. collectables, like hidden collectables or coins like mario.
8. add sound effects like walking and different textures
