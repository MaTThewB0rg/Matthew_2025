### My ideas for rpg game

Here are some of my ideas I could implement into my rpg game.

   - A maze
 - a tag-type gamemode
 - collectables like hidden items or coins
 - A racing gamemode
 - NPCs that give out stuff like items and missions
 - having the ability to loot and collect stuff like weapons and items
  - different objectives like quests or missions
- rewards for doing quests
